# Smart Healthcare Management System
The Smart Healthcare Management System is a digital healthcare solution designed to streamline patient, doctor, and hospital operations while introducing intelligent AI-based assistance. The system first establishes a strong foundation with Patient & Medical Record Management, ensuring secure, centralized storage of demographics, medical history, prescriptions, and test reports, along with Doctor & Appointment Management that allows smooth online booking, rescheduling, and reminders. It further enhances clinical workflow with Prescription & Investigation Management, where doctors can upload digital prescriptions and diagnostic results for easy patient access, and Billing & Insurance Automation, which simplifies invoice generation, claim processing, and payment tracking. On top of these core functions, the system integrates AI-driven features such as an AI-Powered Disease Prediction & Symptom Checker that analyzes patient symptoms and history to suggest possible conditions and AI-Based Smart Recommendations & Preventive Care, which guides patients to the right doctors, suggests necessary investigations, and provides preventive health reminders. Altogether, this project creates a comprehensive, intelligent, and patient-centric healthcare ecosystem that improves efficiency, reduces errors, and supports proactive health management.
